# **How to Learn**  
## *What is a project?*  
* *This is a typical one-page site. It was written using HTML and CSS. When writing the site were affected: flexbox layout, positioning and advanced semantics of the HTML language. Animation. Styles are structured according to Nested BEM rules.*  
* *This is my first project. The site will not be finalized, it will be remembered :)*
